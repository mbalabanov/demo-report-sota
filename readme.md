# Analysis of State of the Art by Spaceballs

This is a write-up of my analysis of the demo "State of the Art" by Spaceballs. The demo was released in 1992 and is considered a classic in the Amiga demoscene. The demo is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/89wq5EoXy-0?si=k_YkoRYybniBv5w5) and [Pouet](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=99).

The demo gained widespread acclaim for its innovative use of real-time 2D vector graphics, animation, and sound, becoming an iconic piece in the history of the Amiga demoscene.

Let's take a look at the demo and see what we can learn from it.

The article was released on my website [MarinComics](https://marincomics.com/sota/).
