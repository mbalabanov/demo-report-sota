    <p>
      "State of the Art" is a groundbreaking Amiga demo created by the Norwegian
      demogroup Spaceballs, released in 1992. This demo gained widespread
      acclaim for its innovative use of real-time 2D vector graphics, animation,
      and sound, becoming an iconic piece in the history of the demoscene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demo features a minimalistic black and white design, which creates a
      striking visual impact. It is composed of multiple scenes that showcase
      the technical prowess of a regular Amiga 500 and the artistic capabilities
      of Spaceballs. It was small enough to be saved on a single 880Kb floppy
      disk. "State of the Art'' won first place at the "The Party" in 1992.
    </p>
    <p>Let's take a closer look at the details of "State of the Art".</p>

    <h2>Demo Description</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The demo starts with the Spaceballs logo, followed by the title "State of
      the Art" appearing on the screen. The text is presented in a stylized,
      futuristic font that sets the tone for the rest of the demo.
    </p>

    <h3>Dancers</h3>
    <p>
      The first main scene features silhouettes of dancers in various poses. The
      dancers are represented by 2D vector graphics, with their movements being
      smoothly animated. The animation is synchronized to the electronic music
      track, creating an immersive audiovisual experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Rotating Objects</h3>
    <p>
      This scene showcases rotating 2D objects, such as stars and triangles. The
      objects morph and change shape as they rotate, demonstrating the
      capabilities of the Amiga's graphics hardware.
    </p>

    <h3>Spiraling Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      In this scene, the demo displays spiraling patterns that continuously
      morph and change shape. These intricate patterns are rendered in real-time
      and are synchronized with the pulsating electronic soundtrack, providing a
      mesmerizing visual experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Waveform Visualizer</h3>
    <p>
      The demo features a waveform visualizer that responds to the beats and
      frequencies of the music track. The waveforms are rendered as white lines
      on a black background, creating a mesmerizing, dynamic effect that adds
      another layer of depth to the audiovisual experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Wireframe Cityscape</h3>
    <p>
      A 3D wireframe cityscape is presented, with buildings and structures
      appearing to be drawn in real-time. This showcases the Amiga's ability to
      render complex 3D scenes.
    </p>

    <h3>Kaleidoscope</h3>
    <p>
      This scene features a kaleidoscope effect, with the screen filled with an
      ever-changing array of symmetrical patterns. The patterns react to the
      music, creating a hypnotic and synchronized audiovisual experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Dancers Reprise</h3>
    <p>
      The dancers from the earlier scene return, this time with new poses and
      animations. Their movements continue to be synchronized to the music,
      further emphasizing the tight integration of visual and auditory elements
      in the demo.
    </p>

    <h3>Credits and Greetings</h3>
    <p>
      The demo concludes with a credits sequence, acknowledging the individuals
      responsible for the creation of "State of the Art." The names of the group
      members and their roles are presented in a stylish font, accompanied by
      greetings to other demoscene groups and individuals.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating the Demo</h2>
    <p>
      The longest section in "Stage of the Art" shows the silhouettes of the
      female dancers gyrating to the pounding music. The footage was recreated
      as vector graphics by the members of Spaceballs, who had to manually trace
      the shapes for each frame of their demo. A tedious process described in
      "Demoscene: The Amiga Years, Volume 1 1984 - 1993" by Ã‰ditions 64K:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We started to work on the demo for numerous hours, spanning several
      months. Major Asshole manually drew all the animations by hand, Lone Starr
      created a specific piece of drawing software for that project. We then
      used a genlock to display a fixed video image in the background. However,
      as the sync signal was too bad for the genlock, I used the camera to film
      the TV set that showed the fixed images to the VHS recorder."
    </p>

    <p>
      A year later, Spaceballs released another impressive demo called "9
      Fingers". This time they asked two of their female friends to dance and
      filmed them with a video camera. The original footage of the dancing
      ladies in "9 Fingers" can still be found in the Youtube documentary "Two
      Women that changed the Amiga Demo scene" https://youtu.be/QZ6419ZuVaE.
