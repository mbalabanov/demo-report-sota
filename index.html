              Imagine storing a full music video with music and graphical
              effects on a single 3.5" disk in the Amiga format that had a
              capacity of 880KB. This is what the "State of the Art" demo was. A
              full MTV quality music video executed in realtime on a forty year
              old machine, the

            <p>
              One of the most striking aspects of this demo is its use of
              animated vector sequences converted from real-life video footage.
              Rendering images using geometric shapes like lines and curves.

              When the audience at the demoparty "The Party" in 1992 saw the
              "State of the Art" demo on the Commodore Amiga, they were blown
              away. It looked like a freaky, avantgarde music video that would
              not have been out of place on MTV. The Norwegian demogroup
              Spaceballs combined real-time 2D vector graphics, animation, and
              sound in their demo.
            </p>

            <p>
              Spaceballs musician included a driving, energetic electronic
              soundtrack that blends elements of techno and chiptune styles in
              the demo. It has fast tempo, rhythmic beats, and the use of
              synthesizer sounds that were typical of the era.

            <p>
              "State of the Art" was presented to the demoscene in 1992 at a
              demoparty in Denmark. This is an event where enthusiasts and
              creators in the demoscene community gather to share, celebrate,
              and compete in creating demos. A group of teenagers from Norway
              created the "State of the Art" demo. They called themselves
              Spaceballs, just like the Mel Brooks pastiche of Star Wars from
              the 1980s. The demo blew the minds of the audience. It not only
              won the hearts and minds of the participants but was awarded first
              prize in the category Amiga Demo.
            </p>

            <p>
              And now a deep dive into the different sections of the demo...
            </p>

              alt="Overview of State of the Art"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">1. Demo Intro</h3>
            <p>
              The demo starts with the Spaceballs logo, followed by the title
              "State of the Art" appearing on the screen. The text is presented
              in a stylized, futuristic font that sets the tone for the rest of
              the demo.
            </p>

              alt="Intro of the demo"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">2. Dancing Silhouettes</h3>
            <p>
              The first main scene features silhouettes of dancers in various
              poses. The dancers are represented by 2D vector graphics, with
              their movements being smoothly animated. The animation is
              synchronized to the electronic music track, creating an immersive
              audiovisual experience.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image03.webp"
              alt="The Silhouettes of Dancers"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">3. Rotating Objects</h3>
            <p>
              This scene showcases rotating 2D objects, such as stars and
              triangles. The objects morph and change shape as they rotate,
              demonstrating the capabilities of the Amiga's graphics hardware.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image04.webp"
              alt="Triangles, circles and stars rotating"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">4. Spiraling Patterns</h3>
            <p>
              In this scene, the demo displays spiraling patterns that
              continuously morph and change shape. These intricate patterns are
              rendered in real-time and are synchronized with the pulsating
              electronic soundtrack, providing a mesmerizing visual experience.
            </p>

              src="img/sota-image05.webp"
              alt="Patterns spiraling across the dancing silhouettes"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">5. Waveform Visualizer</h3>
            <p>
              The demo features a waveform visualizer that responds to the beats
              and frequencies of the music track. The waveforms are rendered as
              white lines on a black background, creating a mesmerizing, dynamic
              effect that adds another layer of depth to the audiovisual
              experience.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image06.webp"
              alt="The dancing silhouettes get distorted by the waveform visualizer"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">6. Wireframe Cityscape</h3>
            <p>
              A 3D wireframe cityscape is presented, with buildings and
              structures appearing to be drawn in real-time. This showcases the
              Amiga's ability to render complex 3D scenes.
            </p>

              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">7. Kaleidoscope</h3>
            <p>
              This scene features a kaleidoscope effect, with the screen filled
              with an ever-changing array of symmetrical patterns. The patterns
              react to the music, creating a hypnotic and synchronized
              audiovisual experience.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image08.webp"
              alt="The dancing silhouettes in a kaleidoscope of glitch effects"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">8. Dancers Reprise as Oulines</h3>
            <p>
              The dancers from the earlier scene return, this time with new
              poses and animations. Their movements continue to be synchronized
              to the music, further emphasizing the tight integration of visual
              and auditory elements in the demo.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image09.webp"
              alt="The dancers are transformed into outlines over a light gradient"
              class="img-fluid my-4"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">9. Credits and Greetings</h3>
            <p>
              The demo concludes with a credits sequence, acknowledging the
              individuals responsible for the creation of "State of the Art."
              The names of the group members and their roles are presented in a
              stylish font, accompanied by greetings to other demoscene groups
              and individuals.
            </p>

            <p>
              The original version of "State of the Art" that was released at
              the demoparty only ran on an Amiga 500. It crashed on an Amiga
              1000 and 1200. So weeks after the release, a demogroup called
              Skid-Row debugged and corrected the demo to make it run on other
              models of the Amiga.
            </p>

              While debugging the demo and implementing the fix, Skid-Row took
              the opportunity to add a disrespectful comment (or "dis") to the

            <p>
              When Spaceballs released "State of the Art", the demo was
              well-received. Some demoscener lauded the amazing graphics, the
              realistic dancing sillhouettes, the length of the demo and the
              pumping music. It deservedly won.
            </p>

            <p>
              But there were also critical voices. Some didn't think that it
              acted more like a prerecorded animation and not like a demo.
              Others didn't like the techno music.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the years since its release, "State of the Art" has risen in
              recognition to a reverential level. Not only Amiga enthusiasts
              sing it praise on

              Often heralded as the greatest Amiga demo ever made (good
              arguments for and against both ways), it sure made a *huge*
              impression when it came out over 10 years ago.<br />My friend
              invited me over to his house at the time to check out this
              "amazing new Spaceballs demo" he had just downloaded. I had a
              386/33 PC at the time, and the demoscene was virtually nonexistent
              on that platform, so when he popped this in and the purple girl
              silhouettes appeared, with the Vinnie-tracked loadertune (basic,
              but effectively gets you in the mood for what's to follow), I knew
              I was about to see something great. Just the way the screen cycled
              from white to purple, scaling out to reveal a hand was really
              cool. Even though there's nothing all that special about the
              effects, their execution is top-notch, and well-synched. Using
              ancient interference effects with the (what I'm guessing is)
              rotoscoped dancing animations, along with one of Travolta's most
              memorable tunes, combined to create an experience that was tough
              to match at the time.<br />A comment most often heard was that it
              was good enough to put on MTV. Seeing it today on bigger monitors,
              I always feel like that final strobe sequence is going to give me
              a seizure. 😆<br />Definitely a classic, and deserving of a:

              Maybe the level of hyperbole in most of the overwhelmingly
              positive comments there is exaggerated and unwarranted. There are
              other great demos of the same vitage on the Amiga e.g. "Hardwired"
              by Crionics and The Silents (1991), and "Desert Dream" by Kefrens
              (1993). And the 2000s brought a large variety of beatiful and
              remarkable demos by demo groups like Farbrausch and Fairlight. But
              all the exuberant praise for "State of the Art" is an expression
              of true admiration and enthusiasm

              One of the negative reviewers even speculated that Spaceballs'
              "State of the Art" might have been inspired by a slightly similar
              demo on the Amiga called "Deformations" which was released in the
              spring of the same year at the Polish demoparty Warszawa 1992. It
              was also awarded first place. It has a very different nature but
              also features silhouettes of dancers to sampled music with vocals.

              community, participating in and sometimes organizing demoparties
              and other community events. In the 1990s, Spaceballs also released
              nine issues of the diskmag “R.A.W” (short for “Random Article

            <p>
              A diskmag is an electronic magazine distributed on a floppy disk.
              They are written, edited and distributed by enthusiasts in the
              scene. Some diskmags are simply text files with some rudimentary
              diagrams composed of letter characters (ASCII art). Others are
              complete applications with artful user interfaces, virtual pages
              with formatted text and graphics. It was good form for many
              diskmags in the demoscene to start with intros that presented
              graphics, effects and music. The more elaborate demoscene diskmags
              had accompanying tracks of new music playing in the background
              while users read the articles.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what Daniel Botz wrote about diskmags in his doctorial
              thesis "Kunst, Code und Maschine. Die Ästhetik der

                media such as 'Diskmags', short for 'Disk Magazines', also
                called Scene Mags or Diskzines. These journalistic products
                contain information about the founding, dissolution and
                restructuring of demo groups, reports from demo parties or
                reviews of new demos. While these products are part of the scene
                and therefore an object of study, they also serve as important
                sources of information, for example for dating demos. While the
                first important scene magazine, 'Illegal' from Germany, was
                still published on paper, the later Diskmags appeared like demos

              Spaceballs pushed the boundaries of what was possible in demo
              programming on the Amiga. They are electronic artists of the
              underground. Their work has influenced many other demoscene groups
              and individuals, inspiring new techniques and styles. Beyond
              technical prowess, Spaceballs' demos are known for their
              distinctive artistic style, often featuring bold colors,
              innovative graphics, and synchronized music. The music in their
              demos is an integral part of the experience, often driving the
              pace and mood of the visuals.

              Spaceballs' contribution to the demoscene goes beyond just their
              technical achievements; they have been a part of shaping the
              culture and artistic expression within the community, inspiring
              generations of programmers, artists, and musicians within the
              demoscene and- beyond.

              Now it is time to delve into the demo's history, which starts in
              the past, because that is how history works, and the demo was
              created in the summer of 1992 (which happens to be in the past).

              Over the years, Spaceballs had an ever changing roster with many

              The group used a video camcorder to record two girls of
              approximately their age who were dance enthusiasts. They would use
              this footage as the basis for the dancing figures. But getting
              there was not easy.

              Lone Starr and Major Asshole were the coders. Lone Starr
              programmed a tool to painstakingly and manually trace the dancing
              silhouettes frame by frame.

              The Amiga could display the video footage. This was not an actual
              import in the sense that we would understand it today. The footage
              would only be displayed in the background on the Amiga's screen

              This time, Major Asshole used the footage to trace the outlines of
              the dancer as vector paths. This was slow and laborious. Yet once
              the clips had been traced, Major Lone Starr and Asshole could fill
              the outlines with any color they wanted. They could scale the
              vector images, rotate them and flip them. This process of tracing
              the outlines of a figure on video or film is called

              Travolta composed and coded the spectacular music of the demo.
              It's pulsating beats were very on point for the early 1990s, often
              compared by other with the industrial techno music popular in
              Germany. Tmb Design provided the spot illustrations and incidental
              graphics.

              Here is an excerpt from Spaceballs' R.A.W. diskmag describing the
              "making of" the demo:
            </p>

            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              <p>
                I began planning a demo early in the summer 1992. Major Asshole
                had some ideas of how to save animations from videotapes as
                2d-vector figures, and soon I began to write a program where I
                could make such animations. This program had many possibilities.
                It could morph, zoom and move objects, and it was able to do
                animations up to four planes. It took 5 months before the final
                version of this tool was finished. (I didn't work more than
                maximum 4 hours a week this period.) And then I began to make
                STATE OF THE ART.
              </p>

              <p>
                I wanted to make a totally different demo, which I knew was
                possible when using my new tool. I wanted to make a demo with
                people dancing around on the screen. And the demo should run in
                every 2nd frame. I talked with some girls I knew, and they were
                willing to dance. Sverre (a major asshole) took his camcorder
                over to my place, and on the 11th of December we shot the
                dance-sequences. Until then almost almost nothing of the demo
                was finished, now the real work began. Sverre began converting
                all the animations from videotape to the computer using my tool.
                I coded the routines and put the demo together. Travolta made a
                new version of the music, the first version lasted for five
                minutes. TMB-designs made the graphics and some design.
              </p>

              <p>
                The 23rd of December there was half a minute of the demo left to
                finish, and we were #%! bored of spending time on the demo. Two
                days later we went to the Party, and we finished the demo there.
                TMB-Designs adjusted all the colors, and he forced me to do some
                (many) !# changes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Anway the result was better! (I hope...) The final version of
                the demo was finished 6 hours before deadline, and I had no
                chance to reach making a compatible version for A500+, !1200
                etc. I'm sorry. Anyway, after we had won I was so ##^! bored of
                the demo, that I almost burned all my source-codes, and
                therefore I didn't make a compatible version. Anyway Skid-Row
                made on 1 week later. Just to comment what Skid-Row did, I would
                like to thank them for making a compatible version, but the text
                at the end really sucks!
              </p>

              <p>
                They wrote: "How could they win?". We won because this demo had
                a new different style, and it was a demo all kind of
                amiga-owners would enjoy, not only the coders. I admit the
                coding isn't any special, but it's not lame! (like Skid-Row
                said.) I think demos like this will be new genre for demos
                coming.
              </p>

                This was just a beginning for Spaceballs! Wait, watch and
                wriggle!.....??

              Beyond their own coverage of the demo's creation, members of
              Spaceballs were even interviewed by the "It's Art" magazine from
              the US about their motications and process. Unfortunately, this
              was a printed niche periodical with a low circulation and I could
              not find it anywhere. The only excerpts remain in a

              Changing the State of the Demo Art
            </h2>
            <p>
              With "State of the Art", Spaceballs pushed the boundaries of what
              was possible in demo programming on the Amiga. Their work showed
              other demosceners what could be achieved with planning,
              inspiration and hard work. It influenced other demoscene groups
              and individuals and inspired new techniques and styles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond its technical prowess, this demo proved in 1992 that the
              good stuff was no longer locked away in the future!
