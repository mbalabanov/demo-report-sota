            <h3>
              Achtung: Text aus einer archivierten Fassung von "It's Art
              Magazine"
            </h3>

            <p>
              In 1992, a group named the Spaceballs accomplished State of The
              Art, a demo(nstration) introduced at "The Party 2". This demo of
              almost four minutes, able to start from a simple density disk, was
              a major revolution in the art of the demo. For the first time,
              somebody had succeeded to prove that it was possible to accomplish
              a video-clip comparable to professional productions, but on a
              simple personal computer.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is necessary to remind you of the significance of demo word in
              this context, which strictly has nothing to do with the word used
              when speaking about a restricted or evaluated version to a
              commercial software. The art of demo, such as introduced here, is
              the capacity to make a real-time calculated program which links
              visual effects and original music. The art of the demo is a way of
              demonstrating a programmer, musician, or else graphic designer
              skills in a same unit of time.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1992, Amiga ruled the demo scene, but State Of The Art caused a
              true earthquake in the demos group community and all its fans.
              While most part of demos introduced technical parts trying to put
              forward feats of programming which could be annoying for the
              non-initiating, State of The Art erased the programming aspect to
              accomplish a visual assemblage worthy of the best dance video
              clips from this time ...

            <p>
              When the audience at the demoparty "The Party" in 1992 saw the
              "State of the Art" demo on the Commodore Amiga, they were blown
              away. It looked like a freaky, avantgarde music video that would
              not have been out of place on MTV. The Norwegian demogroup
              Spaceballs combined real-time 2D vector graphics, animation, and
              sound in their demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demo features a minimalistic black and white design, which
              creates a striking visual impact. It is composed of multiple
              scenes that showcase the technical prowess of a regular Amiga 500
              and the artistic capabilities of Spaceballs. It was small enough
              to be saved on a single 880Kb floppy disk. "State of the Art'' won
              first place at the "The Party" in 1992.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Demo Analysis</h2>

            <p>
              Let's take a closer look at the details of "State of the Art".
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image01.png"

              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">1. Demo Intro</h3>
            <p>
              The demo starts with the Spaceballs logo, followed by the title
              "State of the Art" appearing on the screen. The text is presented
              in a stylized, futuristic font that sets the tone for the rest of
              the demo.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image02.png"
              alt="Intro of the demo"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">2. Dancing Silhouettes</h3>
            <p>
              The first main scene features silhouettes of dancers in various
              poses. The dancers are represented by 2D vector graphics, with
              their movements being smoothly animated. The animation is
              synchronized to the electronic music track, creating an immersive
              audiovisual experience.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image03.png"
              alt="The Silhouettes of Dancers"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">3. Rotating Objects</h3>
            <p>
              This scene showcases rotating 2D objects, such as stars and
              triangles. The objects morph and change shape as they rotate,
              demonstrating the capabilities of the Amiga's graphics hardware.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image04.png"
              alt="Triangles, circles and stars rotating"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">4. Spiraling Patterns</h3>
            <p>
              In this scene, the demo displays spiraling patterns that
              continuously morph and change shape. These intricate patterns are
              rendered in real-time and are synchronized with the pulsating
              electronic soundtrack, providing a mesmerizing visual experience.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image05.png"
              alt="Patterns spiraling across the dancing silhouettes"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">5. Waveform Visualizer</h3>
            <p>
              The demo features a waveform visualizer that responds to the beats
              and frequencies of the music track. The waveforms are rendered as
              white lines on a black background, creating a mesmerizing, dynamic
              effect that adds another layer of depth to the audiovisual
              experience.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image06.png"
              alt="The dancing silhouettes get distorted by the waveform visualizer"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">6. Wireframe Cityscape</h3>
            <p>
              A 3D wireframe cityscape is presented, with buildings and
              structures appearing to be drawn in real-time. This showcases the
              Amiga's ability to render complex 3D scenes.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image07.png"
              alt="Vector cityscapes drawn in real-time"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">7. Kaleidoscope</h3>
            <p>
              This scene features a kaleidoscope effect, with the screen filled
              with an ever-changing array of symmetrical patterns. The patterns
              react to the music, creating a hypnotic and synchronized
              audiovisual experience.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image08.png"
              alt="The dancing silhouettes in a kaleidoscope of glitch effects"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">8. Dancers Reprise as Oulines</h3>
            <p>
              The dancers from the earlier scene return, this time with new
              poses and animations. Their movements continue to be synchronized
              to the music, further emphasizing the tight integration of visual
              and auditory elements in the demo.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/sota-image09.png"
              alt="The dancers are transformed into outlines over a light gradient"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h3 class="mt-2">9. Credits and Greetings</h3>
            <p>
              The demo concludes with a credits sequence, acknowledging the
              individuals responsible for the creation of "State of the Art."
              The names of the group members and their roles are presented in a
              stylish font, accompanied by greetings to other demoscene groups
              and individuals.
            </p>

            <p>
              The original version of "State of the Art" that was released at
              the demoparty only ran on an Amiga 500. It crashed on an Amiga
              1000 and 1200. So weeks after the release, a demoscener called
              Skidrow debugged and corrected the demo to make it run on other
              models of the Amiga.
            </p>

            <p>The good Stuff was no longer locked away in the future</p>

            <img

              alt="The finale with the credits and greetings"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h2 class="mt-4">Demo Reviews</h2>

            <p>
              When the demo was released, it turned many heads. But there was
              also criticism. Let's explore the reviews at the time and the ones
              written decades later.
            </p>

            <img
              src="img/raw-sota-reviews.jpg"
              alt="The reviews of the demo in the R.A.W. diskmag"
              class="img-fluid"
            />

            <h4>Zeque:</h4>
            <p>
              Now this is a design-demo. Basically only one routine, a lot of
              2D-coordinates and a groovy tune. Still a very good demo, though
              it does get a bit boring and repetitive towards the end. A big
              minus for not working with my A1000 for this one, too.
            </p>

            <h4>Chaos:</h4>
            <p>
              Why does he demos? He should get himself a videocamera and make
              music videos NOTHING is realtime in this prod, (exept some simple
              transformations, he told me). If you like it, watch MTV, you will
              get something better.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is perhaps one way of defending this demo. He just wanted to
              do something like a techno video, and he did, but it has nothing
              to do with a scene that i want to be part of. If he likes doing
              teckno videos, he should stop using amiga and start using video.
              He will get better results with less work. He could as well use a
              table tennis ball to play soccer. It's possible, but stupid
              (except for some silly situations).
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't have to say something about compatibility, Skid Row said
              everything that has to be said about this subject....
            </p>

            <p>
              If this is the state of the art, I should start looking for
              another scene.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the way, if you think that it is a new idea to use the shadow
              of dancers in a demo, then take a look at the Deformations demo
              from Deform, It was released at a copy party in Warschau/Poland in
              spring '92 and won the competition. Musashi (the coder) combined
              the animation with real code, and using a nice music sample he
              gained a much better effect. Well, who is interested in polnish
              demos...

            <h2>The History of Spaceballs</h2>

            <p>Spaceballs' Contribution to the Demoscene</p>
            <p>
              Members of Spaceballs have been active in the demoscene community,
              participating in and sometimes organizing demoparties and other
              community events. In the 1990s, Spaceballs not released demos but
              also the diskmag ‚ÄúR.A.W‚Äù (short for ‚ÄúRandom Article Writer‚Äù).
            </p>
            <p>
              A diskmag is an electronic magazine distributed on a floppy disk.
              They are written, edited and distributed by enthusiasts in the
              scene. Some diskmags are simply text files with some rudimentary
              diagrams composed of letter characters (ASCII art). Others are
              complete applications with artful user interfaces, virtual pages
              with formatted text and graphics. It was good form for many
              diskmags in the demoscene to start with intros that presented
              graphics, effects and music. The more elaborate demoscene diskmags
              had accompanying tracks of new music playing in the background
              while users read the articles.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what Daniel Botz wrote about diskmags in his doctorial
              thesis "Kunst, Code und Maschine. Die √Ñsthetik der
              Computer-Demoszene" (translated by the writer of this piece):
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              <p>
                "Since its early days, the scene has had its own publication
                media such as 'Diskmags', short for 'Disk Magazines', also
                called Scene Mags or Diskzines. These journalistic products
                contain information about the founding, dissolution and
                restructuring of demo groups, reports from demo parties or
                reviews of new demos. While these products are part of the scene
                and therefore an object of study, they also serve as important
                sources of information, for example for dating demos. While the
                first important scene magazine, 'Illegal' from Germany, was
                still published on paper, the later Diskmags appeared like demos
                in disk form and were exchanged and copied in parallel with
                demos and software."

              The demogroup pushed the boundaries of what was possible in demo
              programming on the Amiga. Their work has influenced many other
              demoscene groups and individuals, inspiring new techniques and
              styles. Beyond technical prowess, Spaceballs' demos are known for
              their distinctive artistic style, often featuring bold colors,
              innovative graphics, and synchronized music. The music in their
              demos is an integral part of the experience, often driving the
              pace and mood of the visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spaceballs' contribution to the demoscene goes beyond just their
              technical achievements; they have been a part of shaping the
              culture and artistic expression within the community, inspiring
              generations of programmers, artists, and musicians within the
              demoscene and beyond.

            <h2 class="mt-4">Creating the Demo</h2>

            <p>
              Let's take a look at the demo's history, which starts in the past,
              because the demo was created in the summer of 1992.
            </p>
            <p>
              The longest section in "Stage of the Art" shows the silhouettes of
              the female dancers gyrating to the pounding music. The footage was
              recreated as vector graphics by the members of Spaceballs, who had
              to manually trace the shapes for each frame of their demo. A
              tedious process described in "Demoscene: The Amiga Years, Volume 1
              1984 - 1993" by √âditions 64K:
            </p>
            <p>
              "We started to work on the demo for numerous hours, spanning
              several months. Major Asshole manually drew all the animations by
              hand, Lone Starr created a specific piece of drawing software for
              that project. We then used a genlock to display a fixed video
              image in the background. However, as the sync signal was too bad
              for the genlock, I used the camera to film the TV set that showed
              the fixed images to the VHS recorder."

              from RAW issue 5 - May 1993)
            </p>

            <p>The most popular demo in 1992 was State Of The Art.</p>
            <p>
              A techno demo with dancing girls. So who are these dancing girls ?
            </p>
            <p>We got one of the girls and asked her some questions.</p>

            <p>Name, Age and Interests ?</p>
            <p>
              My name is Jannicke Selmer-Olsen. I am nearly 17 years old. I
              dance discojazz/freestyle once a week. The 6 other days I use at
              playing in a musical called Pleasure Done with the dance group
              Behind The Mask. If i've ogt time I'm also a girl guide. Paul is
              also one of my interests.
            </p>

            <p>So why are you in this demonstration from Paul ?</p>
            <p>I just showed Paul my legs and he let me dance.....</p>

            <p>How long time did you use to records the dancing ?</p>
            <p>Since we are so marvelous dancers we only used one hour.</p>

            <p>
              (She won a norwegian championship in disco dancing years back)
            </p>

            <p>Which music did you listen to while recording ?</p>
            <p>We listened to the same as in the demo.</p>

            <p>Are you a fan of techno music ?</p>
            <p>
              Not really. I am quite fond of Indian music. The cure, DM and so
              on.
            </p>

            <p>What do you think about the result of the demo ?</p>
            <p>Not bad. Paul is a very clever boy.</p>

            <p>What do you think about the music in the demo ?</p>
            <p>It's alright! But it is a bit fast at the end !</p>

            <p>What do you think of Paul ?</p>
            <p>A sexy, pretty, strong, clever, kind guy! (Melt...)</p>

            <p>
              (Ed: How can a boy with weight 45 KG and 1.50 high be STRONG!)
            </p>

            <p>Something else to add ?</p>
            <p>eh.. Not really! It was fun working with Paul. Bye !</p>

            <p>Lone Starr at The Party 2 (december 1992)</p>
            <p>
              You may noticed that the girl was a bit "friendly" to Lone Starr.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wouldn't you also been that if you got $150 dollar for a hour
              work. 5% of the winning money went to the Jannicke.

              A year later, Spaceballs released another impressive demo called
              "9 Fingers". This time they asked two of their female friends to
              dance and filmed them with a video camera. The original footage of
              the dancing ladies in "9 Fingers" can still be found in the
              Youtube documentary "Two Women that changed the Amiga Demo scene"

            <h2>A Possible Source of Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
              Another similar demo on the Amiga called "Deformations" was
              released in the spring of the same year at the Polish demoparty
              Warszawa 1992 and was awarded first place. It has a very different
              nature but also features silhouettes of dancers to sampled music
              with vocals. ( https://youtu.be/yN3JkL6nhKU?si=6prljJ0ZWVJSHPIh )

            <h3>Footnote</h3>
            <p>
              Genlock is short for "generator locking," a technique used in
              video production and broadcasting to synchronize the Amiga with
              multiple video sources, such as cameras or video recorders, with a
              common reference signal. The genlock signal, also known as a
              reference signal or sync signal, is used to ensure that all video
              sources are synchronized to the same frame rate, phase, and color
              timing.
